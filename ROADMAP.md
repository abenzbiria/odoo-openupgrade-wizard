# TODO

* with coop it easy :
- short_help of group decorator ? seems useless...

* add constrains on ``--step`` option.


* revert : set 777 to log and filestore to be able to write on this folder
  inside the containers. TODO, ask to coop it easy or commown for better alternative.

* allow to call odoo-bin shell, via : https://github.com/d11wtq/dockerpty
  (see https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/247)
