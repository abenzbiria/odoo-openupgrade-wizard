# odoo-openupgrade-wizard

Odoo Openupgrade Wizard is a tool that helps developpers to make major
upgrade of Odoo Community Edition. (formely OpenERP).
It works with Openupgrade OCA tools. (https://github.com/oca/openupgrade)

this tool is useful for complex migrations:
- skip several versions
- complex custom code

It will create a migration environment (with all the code available)
and provides helpers to run (and replay) migrations until it works.

# Installation

``pipx install odoo-openupgrade-wizard``.

To develop and contribute to the library, refer to the ``DEVELOP.md`` file.

# Usage

## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard init``

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard init\
  --initial-release=10.0\
  --final-release=12.0\
  --project-name=my-customer-10-12\
  --extra-repository=OCA/web,OCA/server-tools
```

Initialize a folder to make a migration from a 10.0 and a 12.0 database.
This will generate the following structure :

```
config.yml
modules.csv
log/
    2022_03_25__23_12_41__init.log
    ...
scripts/
    step_1__update__10.0/
        pre-migration.sql
        post-migration.py
    step_2__upgrade__11.0/
        pre-migration.sql
        post-migration.py
    step_2__upgrade__12.0/
        pre-migration.sql
        post-migration.py
    step_4__update__12.0/
        pre-migration.sql
        post-migration.py
src/
    env_10.0/
        debian_requirements.txt
        Dockerfile
        odoo.cfg
        python_requirements.txt
        repos.yml
        src/
            odoo/
            openupgrade/
    env_11.0/
        ...
    env_12.0/
        ...

```

* ``config.xml`` is the main configuration file of your project.

* ``modules.csv`` file is an optional file. You can fill it with the list
  of your modules installed on your production. The first column of this
  file should contain the technical name of the module.

* ``log`` folder will contains all the log of the ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard``
  and the logs of the odoo instance that will be executed.

* ``scripts`` folder contains a folder per migration step. In each step folder:
  - ``pre-migration.sql`` can contains extra SQL queries you want to execute
    before beginning the step.
  - ``post-migration.py`` can contains extra python command to execute
    after the execution of the step. (the orm will be available)

* ``src`` folder contains a folder per Odoo version. In each environment folder:

    - ``repos.yml`` enumerates the list of the repositories to use to run the odoo instance.
      The syntax should respect the ``gitaggregate`` command.
      (See : https://pypi.org/project/git-aggregator/)
      Repo files are pre-generated. You can update them with your custom settings.
      (custom branches, extra PRs, git shallow options, etc...)

    - ``python_requirements.txt`` enumerates the list of extra python librairies
      required to run the odoo instance.
      The syntax should respect the ``pip install -r`` command.
      (See : https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/)

    - ``debian_requirements.txt`` enumerates the list of extra system librairies
      required to run the odoo instance.

At this step, you should change the autogenerated files.
You can use default files, if you have a very simple odoo instance without custom code,
extra repositories, or dependencies...


## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard get-code``

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard get-code
```

This command will simply get all the Odoo code required to run all the steps for your migration with the ``gitaggregate`` tools.

The code is defined in the ``repos.yml`` of each sub folders.

**Note**

* This step could take a big while !

**Optional arguments**

if you want to update the code of some given releases, you can provide an extra parameter:

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard get-code --releases 10.0,11.0
```

## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard docker-build``

This will build local docker images that will be used in the following steps.

This script will pull official odoo docker images, defined in the ``Dockerfile`` of
each folder, and build a custom images on top the official one, installing inside
custom librairies defined in ``debian_requirements.txt``, ``python_requirements.txt``.

At this end of this step executing the following command should show a docker image per version.


```
$ docker images --filter "reference=odoo-openupgrade-wizard-*"

REPOSITORY                                                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
odoo-openupgrade-wizard-image---my-customer-10-12---12.0   latest    ef664c366208   2 weeks ago   1.39GB
odoo-openupgrade-wizard-image---my-customer-10-12---11.0   latest    24e283fe4ae4   2 weeks ago   1.16GB
odoo-openupgrade-wizard-image---my-customer-10-12---10.0   latest    9d94dce2bd4e   2 weeks ago   924MB
```

**Optional arguments**

* if you want to (re)build an image for some given releases, you can provide
  an extra parameter: ``--releases 10.0,12.0``

**Note**

* This step could take a big while also !

## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard run``

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard run\
    --step 1\
    --database DB_NAME
```

Run an Odoo instance with the environment defined by the step argument.

The database will be created, if it doesn't exists.

if ``stop-after-init`` is disabled, the odoo instance will be available
at your host, at the following url : http://localhost:9069
(Port depends on your ``host_odoo_xmlrpc_port`` setting of your ``config.yml`` file)

**Optional arguments**

* You can add ``--init-modules=purchase,sale`` to install modules.

* You can add ``stop-after-init`` flag to turn off the process at the end
  of the installation.

## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard install-from-csv``

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard install-from-csv\
    --database DB_NAME
```

Install the list of the modules defined in your ``modules.csv`` files on the
given database.

The database will be created, if it doesn't exists.

## ``odoo-openupgrade-wizard upgrade``

```
odoo-openupgrade-wizard upgrade\
    --database DB_NAME
```

Realize an upgrade of the database from the initial release to
the final release, following the different steps.

For each step, it will :

1. Execute the ``pre-migration.sql`` of the step.
2. Realize an "update all" (in an upgrade or update context)
3. Execute the scripts via XML-RPC (via ``odoorpc``) defined in
   the ``post-migration.py`` file.

**Optional arguments**

* You can add ``--first-step=2`` to start at the second step.

* You can add ``--last-step=3`` to end at the third step.
